# Introduction to the Aries CLI

The Aries CLI is a development tool that assists you with your Aries based self-sovereign identity development.

The CLI makes it easy to create schemas, definitions and credentials, so you can test your Aries application. You can use it both for individual actions or to run automations.

{% hint style="info" %}
Currently, the Aries CLI is on its first release. If you have any feature requests, bugs or recommendations, we'd love to hear them! Open issues or contribute through PRs on our [GitHub](https://github.com/animo/aries-cli) repo.
{% endhint %}

Check out our roadmap to see where we are at and where we are heading, or just get started right away!

### Quickstart

Are you experienced with CLI's and SSI development? The CLI has plenty of built-in documentation to figure it out yourself. Just [install ](guides/installation.md)and run `aries-cli` to get an overview of the features and usage.

We do recommend taking a quick look at our [configuration guide](guides/configuration.md), as the more experienced developer will probably want to use our tenant option or connect their own agent.

### Getting started

Curious how you can use the Aries CLI? You can follow these guides to get everything up and running in no time.

All features are highlighted both in these docs as in the CLI through the `--help` option.
