# Introduction to the Aries CLI

The Aries CLI is a development tool that assists you with your Aries based self-sovereign identity development. You can use it for individual actions, like creating connections, credentials, schema's etc. or you can use it to run automations, like a complete issue credential flow that gives you a generated credential offer. Whether you have been working with verifiable credentials for years, or are just getting started, the CLI will make your life easier.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Currently, Aries-CLI is on its first release. If you have any feature requests, bugs or recommendations, we'd love to hear them! Open issues or contribute through PRs on our [GitHub](https://github.com/animo/aries-cli) repo.
{% endhint %}

Check out our roadmap to see where we are at and where we are heading, or just get started!

### Quickstart

Are you experienced with CLI's and SSI development? The CLI has plenty of built-in documentation to figure it out yourself. Just [install ](guides/installation.md)and run `aries-cli` to get an overview of the features and usage.&#x20;

We do recommend taking a quick look at our [configuration guide](guides/configuration.md), as the more experienced developer will probably want to use our tenant option or connect their own agent.&#x20;

### Getting started

Curious how you can use the Aries CLI? You can follow our [guides](broken-reference) to get everything up and running in no time.&#x20;
